                                                       SQL Project: Analysis of COVID-19 Data
The link to the dataset: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

This project is focused on analyzing COVID-19 data from the Our World in Data project, specifically the "covid-deaths" dataset. The dataset is a daily updated dataset, and it includes information about COVID-19 cases and deaths, as well as population data for different countries and regions.

The SQL queries in this project analyze the dataset in various ways, including:

Displaying rows and columns of the table
Calculating total cases and death percentage at specific locations
Finding COVID-19 cases at locations with more than 100,000 cases
Determining the highest number of infections location wise
Calculating the total death count by continent
Calculating the global death percentage by continent
Finding the global death count based on new cases and new deaths
Analyzing the daily new COVID-19 deaths for a specific location
Analyzing the daily new COVID-19 deaths and the 7-day moving average for specific locations and all locations
Identifying the top 5 countries/regions with the highest number of COVID-19 deaths per million population as of a specific date
Determining the total number of COVID-19 deaths and the average daily new COVID-19 deaths for each country/region with a population greater than 100 million
Identifying the list of countries/regions that have had at least one day with zero new COVID-19 cases after their first reported case.
This project can be useful for anyone interested in understanding the impact of COVID-19 on different countries and regions around the world. It can also be helpful for researchers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals in making informed decisions regarding COVID-19 prevention and treatment strategies.

To run the SQL queries in this project, the user needs to have access to the "covid-deaths" dataset from the Our World in Data project and a database management system (DBMS) such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.

The SQL queries can be copied and pasted into a SQL editor, such as MySQL Workbench or pgAdmin, and executed to obtain the desired results.

Note: The queries in this project were written based on the dataset available as of 2021, and the results may vary depending on the current state of the datase.By analyzing the COVID-19 data using SQL, we can gain valuable insights into the spread of the virus and the effectiveness of vaccination efforts. With the queries provided in this project, you can further explore the data and draw your own conclusions.
